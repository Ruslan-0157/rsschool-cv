<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  I am a Junior developer and recently have finished Lomonosov Moscow State
  University. I love studying mathematic, sketching and programming. At
  university I was working with different projects and tried many languages. My
  main projects, like bachelor thesis were connected to a machine learning and a
  neural network.
</p>
<p>
  I have the ambition to enhance my junior experience to a fullstack web
  development on advance level. Because of my love to sketching and painting I
  have a good sense of web design, architecture, colors and shapes. Therefore,
  the frontend programming is a good start for me.
